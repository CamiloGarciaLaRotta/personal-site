### Euforia is

To float in open waters  
Drifting with the curl  
Smoothly sandwiched  
Between sea and sun  

To jump onto a creek  
Not able to see you own feet  
The midnight water and skin  
Not two, but one  

To run under Summer rain  
Soaked down to the bones  
Sweet vivid heavy drops  
Pouring down like champagne
