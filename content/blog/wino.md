Say what you want about drunkenness. Pull out all the rational, healthy, moral and ethical issues around it.  

But don't do it before you've felt what is like to look at a simple thing that day to day life doesn't give you the energy, time and interest to appreciate. Say for example a cloud. And have the sudden realization of why old paintings were so beautiful. It's because the clouds themselves are beautiful. We simply forgot to observe them. That awe you feel when the colors suddenly make sense. The shadows, degrades and textures strike you deep inside.  

After you have felt that, then I accept those arguments about doing the same without alcohol or drugs. Because not everyone has the strength to do so by itself without understanding the final goal. Getting a glance at what beauty surrounds us if we take our time to read it, I believe is a greater incentive in order to attempt to do so without the help of any substances than promising paradises and afterlife's
