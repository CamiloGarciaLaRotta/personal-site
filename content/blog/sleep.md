An insomniac was sitting on his window counting how many people would walk in front of his street between moans of the couple who lived downstairs. His record was twelve on a Friday night, but this gloomy Wednesday night three was as good as he would get.  

He hadn't been able to sleep a full night since the day he saw his mother die under a snow plow crossing Sherbrooke Street back when he was young. It wasn't a sad souvenir anymore, simply a memory among many others.  

The snow was falling silently over the rooftops of St Henri. Covering all the garbage that spring would sprout back in a couple of months. As the last moan of the night, perfectly timed with the last zip of his beer, came to his ears, he slipped from the window trying to go back into the apartment. Like a puppet without its puppeteer he fell from the fifth floor. His last thought before hitting the ground was the irony that death would take everything from him, but at least he'd be able to catch up on all the sleep he'd missed since that winter back in '93.
