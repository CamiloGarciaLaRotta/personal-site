### Maritimes

Survive a drive through a starry obsidian night  
And you might wake up to a fiery ruby light.  

Warmth will brighten up the lonely rock,  
That wind and sea have cut off from this world.  
Leave your blood at the salty stone dock,  
Then clear your wounds on its icy water pond.  

Your wild animals will push you forth;  
Pop your head out of the car’s window like a dog;  
Smile! Go North!  

Muddy shores with pirate coves,  
Mini-golf scores over magnetic hills.  
No time is wasted, when the only way to go is up ahead.  

But when the forgotten storm  
Brews in the horizon once more,  
recall the story told by the scars you’ve worn,  
Realize how far you’ve come,  
take a leap of faith in yourself.  
Follow the sunrise to the East!  

Through the Atlantic misty bays,  
Without border between nights and days,  
Kayak among silk emerald waters  
Where the bonfires will unfold what truly matters.  

And when in open sea,  
You’ll reach the furthest point from home,  
Remember what made you hit the road.  
Climb up the mast of the Fandango sail  
And scream at the top of your strength:  
“C’est tranquile!”
