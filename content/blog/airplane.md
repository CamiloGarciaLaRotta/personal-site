I once heard someone describe flying commercial airplanes as "hours of boredom followed by 15 seconds of sheer panic".   

I like to think about the pilot and copilot as two teenagers, with their feet up the control panel, going through their Facebook feed and Reddit. Yawning and talking shit on other pilots and stewardess while throwing paper airplanes around the cockpit.   

They would suddenly go ape shit scared when the autopilot light turns off and they have to land the airplane. I picture the copilot rocking back and forth as a stewardess tries to shake some sense into him. The pilot furiously flipping the pages of “How to land a plane for Dummies” as the control tower shouts complex instructions.   

They would then try to play it cool saying goodbye to the passengers at the door, with sweat still pouring down their foreheads and their pants fully crapped.
