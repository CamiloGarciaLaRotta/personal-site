### Matane

The Honda Civic slides through the road   
as the last rays of light hit the underneath of the clouds.  
The windows cracks open and the wind gushes in  
flooding the car with a salty mist.  
We've been driving since dusk  
and we know we won't be able to continue for long,  
but that's ok.Nobody said Matane would be easy to reach.
